# Budgety

**Budgety** is a tool that helps you control your expenses in order to maintain your desired monthly savings, by spending less. It is also an experiment to test human psychology by displaying the remaining daily budget.

From the example above, you start with your fixed monthly income and then subtract the recurring expenses. From what remains (i.e. 2000 - 600 = 1400) you subtract the desired amount you plan on saving. That leaves with you the monthly budget for the rest of your general expenses (groceries, transportation, etc).

From the monthly budget we can derive a **daily budget**.

The above formula is the core of the app. By showing the user the remaining daily budget can we influence him on spending less?
